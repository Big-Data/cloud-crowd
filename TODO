TODO:
	* Use the email field to send mail when the Job's gone bad.
	* Job creation UI. Pick an action, add inputs, set options, go.
	* Unit tests for lib.
	* Look into Grand Central Dispatch for ideas about how to implement
		Job ordering/piping.

DONE:
	* Right now actions just process. Think about map / process / reduce.
	* Basic unit tests.
	* Finish fleshing out the crowd command.
	* Security. HTTP Basic Auth via config.yml,
	* Security. S3 authenticated URLs.
	* Benchmarking mode -- benchmark every single aspect of a job and report it.
	* Pare down the code that the workers are loading to the absolute minimum.
	* Documentation. (document inside of config.yml, too)
	* Think about having the completion of a work unit respond with another one,
	  instead of having to make a second request.
	* Think about having a failed work unit shuffle off to the end of the queue,
		instead of going again right away (and probably being handed back to the
		very same daemon).
	* Replace work_units_remaining with a percent_complete
	* Monitor UI -- see queue of jobs / work units.
	* Basic integration tests.
