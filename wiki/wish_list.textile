A brief list of things it would be nice to see contributed to CloudCrowd:

* A Job Creation UI for the *Operations Center* ... pick your action, add inputs and options, and you're off to the races.
* More unit and acceptance tests.
* Additional storage backends for the AssetStore, besides *s3* and *filesystem*. *Database* and *memcache* backends seem like they would be interesting options.
* Some performance tests and benchmarks, to see what the expected throughput looks like at different levels.
