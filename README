	~ CloudCrowd ~

		* A batch-processing system, map-reduce style
		* Write your scripts in Ruby
		* Built for Amazon EC2 and S3
		* split -> process -> merge
		* As easy as `gem install cloud-crowd`
	
	
	~ Getting started ~
	
		# Install the gem (documentcloud-cloud-crowd until the first official release).
		
		>> sudo gem install cloud-crowd
		
		# Install the CloudCrowd configuration files to a location of your choosing.
		
		>> crowd install ~/config/cloud-crowd
		
		# Now, you can use the full complement of `crowd` commands from inside of
		# this configuration directory. To see the available commands:
		
		>> crowd --help
		
		# Edit the configuration files to your satisfaction, and add AWS credentials.
		
		>> mate ~/config/cloud-crowd/config.yml
		>> mate ~/config/cloud-crowd/database.yml
		
		# Write your actions, and install them into the 'actions' subdirectory.
		# CloudCrowd comes with some default actions as an example.
		
		# To spin up the central server (make sure that you include its location
		# in config.yml), either:
		
		>> crowd server
		
		# or:
		
		>> thin -R config.ru --servers 3 -e production start
		
		# Any server that supports Rack should work with the rackup file.
		
		# Then, to spin up 10 workers:
		
		>> crowd workers start -n 10
		
		# To spin up workers remotely, install the 'cloud-crowd' gem, and copy over
		# your configuration directory.
